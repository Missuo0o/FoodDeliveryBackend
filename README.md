# Food Delivery Backend System

This is the backend system for a food delivery application, built using Spring Boot. The application leverages a range of technologies including MySQL, Redis, RabbitMQ, and integrates with Alibaba Cloud's OSS and WeChat Pay. This system is designed to be scalable, secure, and efficient, utilizing Spring Boot's extensive support for enterprise-grade applications.

## Configuration

The application is configured to run on port 8080 and is set up with production profiles. It uses MyBatis for ORM, JWT for authentication, and includes advanced logging configurations.

### Technologies Used

- **Spring Boot** - Framework for building Java-based applications.
- **MySQL** - Database for storing user and order data.
- **Redis** - Used as a cache and session store.
- **RabbitMQ** - Messaging broker for handling asynchronous processing.
- **JWT** - For securing REST APIs by providing tokens to verify user identity.
- **MyBatis** - Persistence framework integrating with Spring Boot for data handling.
- **Knife4j** - Enhanced Swagger-compatible interface for visualizing RESTful APIs.
- **Alibaba Cloud OSS** - For storage solutions.
- **WeChat Pay** - Payment integration for handling transactions and refunds.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

You need the following installed on your system:

- Java JDK 23
- Maven
- MySQL
- RabbitMQ
- Redis

### Setup

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/food-delivery-backend.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd food-delivery-backend
   ```

3. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   mvn install
   ```

### Configuration

Update the `application.yml` or `application.properties` with your specific settings for MySQL, Redis, RabbitMQ, OSS, and WeChat Pay. This typically includes hosts, ports, usernames, passwords, and other essential configuration details.

Certainly! Here's the section of the README updated to reflect how to run the application using the `java -jar` command instead of Maven directly:

---

## Running the Application

Instead of using Maven to run the application, you can build a jar file and run it directly using the Java command. This is often more suitable for production environments or when deploying the application.

1. First, package the application into a runnable jar file with Maven:

   ```bash
   mvn clean package
   ```

   This command will create a `.jar` file in the `target` directory.

2. Run the application using:

   ```bash
   java -jar target/your-application-name.jar
   ```

   Replace `your-application-name.jar` with the actual name of your jar file generated by Maven.

The application will start running on `http://localhost:8080`.
